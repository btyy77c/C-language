##Project from NC State Class

This program generates a piece of a Mandelbrot graph. 

Don't know what a Mandelbrot graph is?  It's ok, neither did I before I took this class.  Here's a nice youtube video that help explained the graph to me:

Program asks the user for 
   - Minimum real
   - Minimum imaginary
   - Size

The program takes your input numbers, does fancy math to calculate what the Mandelbrot set looks like at that location, and generates a picture in representation of the . 

m_input_1.txt is an example input file. 

To run: download all files and compile using Makefile
  ./mandelbrot OR ./mandelbrot < m_input_1.txt >| output.txt
